1. TF 1.15 not supported by Python 3.8
tensorflow 1.15 files -> won't compile under Puthon 3.8 .. no such compiled wheels

https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/1.15.0/#files 

python3 -m pip install tensorflow-1.15.0-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_11_x86_64.whl 

Tried:

conda env with python 3.8: tf15_py38
python3 -m pip install tensorflow-1.15.0-cp35-cp35m-macosx_10_11_x86_64.whl 

2. Instaling gfootball on py 3.7 + openai baselines on tf 1.15:
	a) conda doesnt seem to work 

Installing a setup to run gfootball + training 

pygame==2.0.0
gym [also installs numpy, future, pyglet, scipy, pyglet, Pillow, cloudpickle] 
six
absl-py
opencv-python==4.2.0.34 
pip install gfootball==2.6 --no-dependencies


trial 1: 
used conda environment: gfootball installs correctly but isnt able to vreate environment (error instanting Player, with some error involving None/Nonetype)

trial2: 
using pyenv -> try later

3. setup openai baselines with tf2: doesnt run 


conda activate openai_tf2

used pip install -e .    on branch tf2
video test failed using pytest

python -m baselines.run --alg=ppo2 --env=Humanoid-v2 --network=mlp --num_timesteps=1e3

fails with: 

python -m baselines.run --alg=ppo2 --env=Humanoid-v2 --network=mlp --num_timesteps=1e3
 
AttributeError: 'EnvSpec' object has no attribute 'entry_point'


4. TF 2 and RLLib on Python 3.8 - runs under conda

Trial 1: using conda

(python3.8.5)
tf 2.4.1
ray 1.1
rllib

conda activate rllib_tf  


Trial 2: under poetry installation of scenic, works using poetry run pip install tensorflow and ray[rllib] --- not recommended, we should poetry add all the required dependencies and then install ray[rllib] : for now not done yet

#TODO: in a new poetry environment try to see if the installation works by poetry install ...

a) used following,  but still showing pandas was missing 
poetry add tensorflow
poetry add 'ray[rllib]'
poetry add dm-tree
poetry add pandas

b) poetry run pip install tensorflow
   poetry run pip install 'ray[rllib]'
