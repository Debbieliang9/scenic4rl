-> try changing the name of Player’s attribute direction to heading  (scenic represents angle in radians by default but users will define in deg if wanted) ---> Maybe bot needed

-> syntax to have working: (1) left/right of (2) ahead/behind of (3) beyond.. (4) in/on region (that you defined) (5) offset by ..
